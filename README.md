IDS Neuroimaging department_Project_Team1

## Network of Interest: 

Default mode, Executive control, Visual, Sensorimotor, Salience, Dorsal attention, Auditory (Raichle et al., 2015).

## Large scale functional connectivity
Using CONN toolbox
1. Preprocessing fMRI and MRI data
2. ROI-to-ROI connectivity between Network of interests
3. Average functional connectivity between desired networks
## Large scale Dynamic Causal Modelling (Razi et al., 2017)
Using SPM package
1. GLM specification
2. Masks
3. Model specification
4. Model estimation
5. Group level analysis (Bayesian model reduction & subsequent Peb of Peb)
6. Average effective connectivity between desired networks
