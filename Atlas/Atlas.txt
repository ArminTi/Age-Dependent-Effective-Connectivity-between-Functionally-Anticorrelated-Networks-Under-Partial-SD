To create a desired atlas with the required region masks, follow these steps:

Step(1): Create a mask for each region individually.

Step(2): Use an image calculator, such as the one in Mango software:
         1- Open Mango
         2- Click on the "Open" option
         3- Select the first mask using the "Open Image" option
         4- Go to the "Image" menu and select "Image Calculator"
         5- In the calculator: 
            a) "this" refers to the currently open mask image 
            b) Multiply it by 1 and set the "this" option before the equal sign to "new" to create a new image
         6- Click "Run Calculation"
         7- In the new image: 
            a) Go to File -> Save As
            b) Enter a name for your new image
            c) In the "Misc" section, uncheck the "GZIP" option to save the image as a NIfTI file (not a compressed file)
            d) Click "Save"
         8- Repeat this step for the remaining masks, but assign each mask a unique multiplier in sequential order (e.g., multiply the second mask by 2, the third mask by 3, and so on)

Step(3): Create a NIfTI atlas file:
         1- Open Mango
         2- Click on the "Open" option
         3- Select and open all the newly created images from the previous step in order using the "Open Image" option
         4- In the first image, go to the "Image" menu and select "Image Calculator"
         5- In the calculator: 
            a) "this" refers to the currently selected image
            b) Use the addition operator (+) to combine the images sequentially using the "Others" option (e.g., this + other(1) + other(2) + ...) 
            c) Set the "this" option before the equal sign to "new" to create a combined image
         6- Click "Run Calculation"
         7- In the new image: 
            a) Go to File -> Save As
            b) Enter a name for the desired atlas image 
            c) In the "Misc" section, uncheck the "GZIP" option to save the image as a NIfTI file (not a compressed file)
            d) Click "Save" 

Step(4): Create a text file with the same name as the NIfTI atlas file:
         1- List the region names in the same order as the images entered in the atlas
         2- Assign each region a corresponding number and separate the number from the name using a tab
         Example: 1	Angular_R
                  2	Supp_Motor_Area_L

Step(5): Move the NIfTI file and the text file of the desired atlas:
         Place both files in the "rois" folder of Conn, located in the directory where the Conn toolbox is installed.

Step(6): Import the atlas in the Conn toolbox:
         1- Go to the SETUP section
         2- In the ROIs part, define a new ROI:
            a) Enter the name of the desired atlas
            b) Under Advanced Options, enable the "Atlas file" checkbox
            c) Import the desired NIfTI atlas file

Step(7): Verify anatomical and functional coregistration:
         a) Go to ROI tools -> Display ROI/anatomical coregistration
         b) Go to ROI tools -> Display ROI/functional coregistration
